                    <p></p>
                    <p>Due to different work flows, we use different statistical tests to determine if the phenotyping results of a knockout line differ from the wild type mice. The two main approaches we are using are a reference range approach for continuous data and a Fisher’s exact test for categorical data.</p>
                    <p>Our statistical analysis is designed to differentiate as efficiently as possible between lines that show a phenotype and lines that do not. However, the criteria for calling a hit are very stringent, in order to make sure that when you order a mouse in, the phenotype we have observed will hold up. The other side of the coin is that we are likely to miss true hits, i.e. have a higher number of false negatives. Therefore we encourage you to take a look at the raw data for phenotypes you are interested in and judge for yourself if a borderline case might actually be a true phenotype, even if it hasn't met our very stringent statistical criteria.</p>
                    <p>
                            For every candidate hit identified in the high-throughput analysis, we went back to the underlying raw data (FCS files for flow cytometry etc) for the candidate strain and appropriate controls and a final call was made by an expert in the field.

                                All tests from the observational screen are carried out on mice of the main Sanger phenotyping pipeline. 
                                An average of 84 mice are phenotyped every week on two separate days. Due to operational reasons, wild type controls are only processed on one of these days. Knockout mice enter the pipeline according to their age and mice from one strain are phenotyped on at least two different days to avoid any day effects. 
                                Due to this set-up, knockout mice cannot be compared to controls on the same day. Using daily controls would also not take advantage of the many wild type data points that are collected over time. 
                                        
                        </p>
                        Hence we wanted an approach which would:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                allow to use wild-type controls accumulated during the study
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                allow to test also samples from days when controls were not tested
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                be robust to any outliers and mitigate batch effects
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                would work for assays with small number of animals per strain
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                allow sex-specific testing 
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                                Therefore we decided to use reference range (RR) approach to analyse the data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Data from at least 70 wild type mice was used to generate a reference range. Knockout lines are considered to be significantly different from wild type mice if 60% of the mice for this strain lie outside the middle 95% of wild type data points, i.e. if they lie above the 97.5th or below the 2.5th percentile of the wild type data. For assays with 2 or 3 mice per gender, separate RRs are constructed for male and female mice, but hits are only called if 60% of samples across both genders are outside their respective reference ranges (3 out of 4 or 4 out of 6).
                                 For assays with at least 4 mice per gender (Blood flow cytometry), males and females are assessed fully separately.        
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                For flow cytometry assays of tissues other than blood, we constructed time-window reference range (TRR), by comparing each KO mouse to at least 70 WT of matching sex closest in time and combining relation to TRR (“within”, “above”, “below”) across all KO mouse from a strain.
                        <p>
                                The reference range approach does not take into account the actual distribution of the knockout data, therefore a p-value cannot be calculated. Assuming that all samples are independent of each other, false positive rates vary between 1 in 4.8 million for 7 mice per gender per knockout line (e.g. 16 week blood) and 1 in 16,000 for 4 mice per knockout line (e.g. for cytotoxicity).

                            The screen for antinuclear antibodies in serum and the test for worm burden in Trichuris infection have a very different data structure than the other assays, as wild types are usually negative and positivity is a strong indication for an abnormal phenotype. These assays are therefore analysed with the categorical Fisher’s exact test.
                         </p>
                        <p>
                                Even though the intensity of antinuclear antibody is quantified on a continuous scale, the main readout is the presence or absence of antibody staining. The data is split into negative (scores 0-1) and positive samples (scores 2-5) and analysed categorically. Similarly, worms in the cecum could be counted to assess worm burden, but the more important finding is that worms are present at all.

                            <p>
The project started in late autumn 2013. In mid-2014, we decided to change the original antibody panels to make them more compatible with the IMPC panels and to replace a few antibodies that had not been working as well as expected. For the T cell panel, this change happened on 9th of June 2014, for the B cell panel on 15th of September 2014. Data collected before and after the panel changes are not directly comparable and were analysed separately (constructing separate reference ranges before and after the panel change). 
  </p>
<p>
We were aware at the start of the project that manual gating of all FCS files would be very time-consuming and started immediately to explore different algorithms to automate the gating process. However, quality control of ongoing phenotyping meant that we still had to gate all files manually before the automated gating was in place. We eventually teamed up with <a href="http://www.terryfoxlab.ca/people-detail/ryan-brinkman/">Ryan Brinkman’s team in Vancouver</a>. and developed a semi-supervised gating algorithm for all our panels except blood after the initial panel change in summer 2014. Getting this right and performing the required validations took longer than anticipated and we therefore ended up with a complete set of manually gated data and an almost complete set of data gated automatically with a semi-supervised algorithm. Both datasets are available in the data download section.
</p>
<p>
Data sent to the IMPC for graphing on the website is based on manual gating. For the consortium publication, we reanalysed all available data with the semi-supervised algorithm and refined the hit calling accordingly. Hits displayed online are therefore based on manual gating but verified with automated gating. We found that automated gating reduced temporal drift in many parameters but had not a huge impact on the hit calling as the reference range only calls extreme phenotypes. For further analysis, especially for potential phenotypes that have not made our stringent cut-off criteria, we recommend using the automated data wherever possible.
</p>
<p> 
Automated semi-supervised gating
Computational gating was performed by Ryan Brinkman’s team with <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowClean.html">flowClean</a>, UFO, and <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowDensity.html">flowDensity</a> . FlowClean was used to perform acquisition-based quality checking to remove anomalous events. Files with fewer than 20,000 events were removed from further analysis. UFO was used to identify outlier samples (e.g., batch effects). FlowDensity was used to enumerate cell populations by automating a predefined gating approach using sequential, supervised bivariate gating analysis to set the best cut-off for an individual marker using characteristics of the density distribution. The parameters for each individual cell population were pre-defined once for all files. The automated analysis data was validated against matched manually analysed data.

                            The blood data was analysed by us and by the IMPC. The reference range approach has been used extensively by WTSI and 3i, but is currently not available as a test in the IMPC statistical pipeline. The IMPC has therefore analysed the same blood data using a mixed model approach which is less stringent and leads to more hits. Hits in blood immunophenotyping will therefore differ between this webpage and the IMPC webpage. Our approach is more conservative and very unlikely to contain false positive results. The IMPC analysis offers an assessment of which genes score a hit with a less stringent statistical approach.

                        <p>Hits were identified by a Mann-Whitney-U test with a p-value cut-off of 0.05 in comparison to concurrent WT controls. The analysis combined data from male and female mice. Significant lines were retested with a second cohort. A final call was made on the combined data from both experiments.

                        <p>Wild type mice clear a Trichuris muris infection completely. Presence of worms in the cecum at day 33 therefore indicates a higher susceptibility. Approximately 10% of wild type mice have a low number of worms in the cecum at day 33. Against this background, 4 out of 6 samples for a given knockout line need to be positive to reach a p-value below 0.01.
                            Data for all mice is available to download from the “More data” tab.

                        <p>Histology scores: Histology sections from mid and distal colon are assessed in four different categories indicating damage to the gut. Categories are scored individually (each on scale 0-3) and combined as a total score.
                            Weight loss: Percentage of reduction in body weight compared to the start of the experiment, from the daily weight measurements.
                            Survival: Number of mice having to be sacrificed because of excessive weight loss before the end of the experiment.
