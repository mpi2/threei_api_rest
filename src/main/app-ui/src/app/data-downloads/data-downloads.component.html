                    Statistics were performed as outlined in the Methods section. Please note that all phenotypic calls identified by the statistics procedure were evaluated by an expert before a call was confirmed.

                    Please note: Nine months into the project, we slightly modified some of the panels to bring them into sync with the panels used across the IMPC. For these procedures, all files were analysed manually and the files generated after the change were also gated with a supervised analysis approach. We provide both datasets and a mapping.
