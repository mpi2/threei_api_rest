<h1>Raw Data Downloads</h1>
            <p>
                    Downloads of small csv files for specific genes and assays are available by using the heat map on our landing page. Click through until you see a graph and then look for the download button. Here we provide bulk downloads of raw data for all assays performed.

                    Statistics were performed as outlined in the Methods section. Please note that all phenotypic calls identified by the statistics procedure were evaluated by an expert before a call was confirmed. Please send an email to project manager Lucie Abeler-Dörner if you require more information on how to use this data (send email) [lucie.abeler-dorner@bdi.ox.ac.uk].

                    Please note: Nine months into the project, we slightly modified some of the panels to bring them into sync with the panels used across the IMPC. For these procedures, all files were analysed manually and the files generated after the change were also gated with a supervised analysis approach. We provide both datasets and a mapping.
