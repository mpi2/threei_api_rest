<h1>How to acknowledge 3i in publications</h1>
<p>
All publications that mainly contain data funded by 3i (e.g. descriptions and results of individual screens, work undertaken by 3i-funded researchers) should have “the 3i consortium” as an author. Contact project manager Lucie Abeler-Dörner for an up-to-date list of names behind the consortium name <a href="mailto:lucie.abeler-dorner@bdi.ox.ac.uk" style="text-decoration: none">Send email</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
All publications that contain work that was directly funded by the 3i grant should acknowledge the grants as follows: “This project was supported by Wellcome Trust grant [100156] (www.immunophenotype.org).” Feel free to add more specifics (e.g. who or which part was funded/supported).
 </p>
 <p>
All publications that use data or protocols generated by 3i should acknowledge the grant is follows: “This project used data/protocols generated by the 3i consortium (www.immunophenotype.org); Wellcome Trust grant [100156].”
