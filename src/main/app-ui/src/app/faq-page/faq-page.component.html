<h1>FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>There is no such thing as a free lunch, so where’s the catch?</h2>
<p>   
There is no catch. The Wellcome Trust has invested this money to create a resource for the scientific community. In fact, we are not only paid to conduct the phenotyping but also to promote the uptake of mouse lines and the use of the phenotyping data we generate so please use this resource and let us know if you have any questions. Of course, the data is freely available, so your competitor will be able to look at it, too. We still think you get a really good deal by combining our data with your expert knowledge to create new hypotheses and by taking on gold-standard knockout mouse lines which have undergone stringent quality control from ES cells to final genotyping.
 </p>
 <h2>Can I order mice or ES cells?</h2>
 <p>
The 3i consortium does not distribute any material itself, but mice and ES cells can be obtained from the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). Type your gene of interest into the search box on www.mousephenotype.org and follow the link to ES cells or mice.
</p>
<h2>How can I access the raw data?</h2>
<p>
FCS files will shortly be available on <a href="https://flowrepository.org/" target="_blank">FlowRepository</a>. 
DSS histology, ANA and ear epidermis images are available on the <a href="https://dev.mousephenotype.org/data/search/impc_images?kw=*" target="_blank">IMPC image portal</a>. Most of the remaining data can be downloaded as csv file in the Data Downloads section on this webpage.
</p>
<h2>Can I use 3i protocols for my own research?</h2>
<p>
Yes, the project is entirely open access. Protocols can be found in the Methods section. Please acknowledge the use of 3i protocols in your grants, posters, talks and publications: “The protocol was developed by the 3i consortium (www.immunophenotype.org); Wellcome Trust grant [100156].”
</p>
<h2>Can I use 3i data in a grant or paper?</h2>
<p>
Yes, the data is also open access. It is mandatory to acknowledge the consortium for the generation of the data: ““This project (or table/figure xxx) uses data generated by the 3i consortium (www.immunophenotype.org); Wellcome Trust grant [100156].”
</p>
<h2>Can I send you my mice for phenotyping?</h2>
 <p>
Unfortunately, we cannot phenotype external mice in the Sanger pipeline. However, we are aiming to provide all our protocols online to enable you to run a 3i-like phenotyping yourself. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate with any of the partners, please contact the members of the consortium directly or send an email to project manager Lucie Abeler-Dörner (send email) [lucie.abeler-dorner@bdi.ox.ac.uk].
