<p>
    The 3i project has established that genetics plays an important role in shaping the immune system. By using a high-throughput, high-density immunophenotyping platform we identified 140 genes (out of 530 screened) that have an impact on the immune system when knocked out in C57BL/6N mice.
</p>
<p>
    3i conducted a broad and deep immunological phenotyping of 530 KO mouse lines generated by the Wellcome Sanger Institute as part of an international effort to generate and phenotype KO mouse lines for all protein-coding genes (<a href="https://mousephenotype.org" target="_blank">IMPC</a>).
</p>
<p>
    Many of the identified genes had never been described to be involved in immunological processes before, thus opening exciting new avenues to study these genes in an immunological context and to link the findings to other areas of physiology.
</p>
<p>
    The phenotyping has two components, an observational and a challenge screen. In the observational screen, the immune compartments of spleen, blood, mesenteric lymph node and bone marrow are analysed by flow cytometry, antinuclear antibodies are detected in the serum and the cytotoxic capacity of spleen CD8 T cells is assessed in vitro. In the challenge screen, separate cohorts of the same KO strains are challenged with Salmonella, Trichuris, influenza and DSS-induced colitis.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, these mice undergo non-immunological phenotyping within the framework of the <a href="https://wwww.mousephenotype.org" target="_blank">IMPC</a>, ranging from tests assessing fertility, anatomical abnormalities, senses, behaviour, and metabolic parameters. 3i also has two sister projects, <a href="https://dmdd.org.uk/" target="_blank">DMDD</a> and <a href="http://www.boneandcartilage.com/phenotyping.html">OCBD</a> which look at embryonic development and bone and cartilage, respectively.
</p>
<p>
    The 3i project is entirely open access and all data is available for download or upon request. The project is led by King’s College London and includes partners at the Sanger Wellcome Institute, Imperial College, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and the Universities of Manchester, Cambridge, and Oxford. 3i is funded by the Wellcome Trust.
