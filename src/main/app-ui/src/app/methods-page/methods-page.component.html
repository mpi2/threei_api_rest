                    The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute currently generates 160 knockout mouse lines a year, all of which are phenotyped by the 3i
                    consortium. One third of the genes are chosen for their likely involvement in human diseases (e.g. as shown in GWAS studies),
                    one third are chosen from suggestions of participating scientists and one third are randomly selected from the International
                    Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) embryonic stem cell pool (see below). Approximately 25% of the knockout lines generated are
                    embryonically lethal and are phenotyped as heterozygotes. Whilst lines homozygous for the targeted alleles present with a higher hit rate,
                    lines assessed in the heterozygous state were still remarkably informative. A characterization of the first 250 knockout mouse lines that completed
                    the Sanger phenotyping pipeline pre-3i has been published by

                            Most of the knockouts lines are generated by a knock-in first approach (Skarnes et al, Nature 2011). This technique combines the advantages of a reporter-tagged allele with a conditional knockout approach (see figure 1).

                            <img src="assets/images/knockout-first-471x451.png"/>
                            <p>Historically, approximately 25% of knockout lines at Sanger have been phenotyped as tm1b alleles and 75% as tm1a alleles. An internal study showed that 60% of the tm1a lines were complete knockouts, 16% were hypomorphs and 24% had residual gene activity. By the end of 2014, all lines will be analysed in their tm1b form. The knock-in first approach relies on the identication of a critical exon common to all trascript variants that, when deleted, creates a frame-shift mutation. The critical exon is defined by a computer-assisted procedure and flanked by loxP sites. Upstream, an FRT-flanked lacZ-loxP-neomycin cassette is inserted. The lacZ-loxP-neomycin cassette contains a splice acceptor and also codes for a poly-A tail. In its full-length form (tm1a), the construct therefore generates a null allele by creating a shortened transcript that lacks the critical exon. A lacZ reporter knockout (tm1b) can be generated by exposing mice or cells to Cre recombinase. Alternatively, exposure to Flp recombinase will create a wild type allele (tm1c) which can then be used to create conditional knockout strains by crossing the mice to a tissue-specific Cre-expressing strain. Genes expressed in ES cells are usually targeted with a promoterless construct, genes not expressed with a promoter-driven construct. Promoter-driven constructs carry a slightly higher risk for off-target effects. If the target gene is small and does not contain a critical exon, an exon is split by the targeting cassette imbedded in an artificial intron. More detailed information on the constructs used can be found in the

            <h3> Challenges</h3>
            <p>In order to find defects in the knockout mice that only become apparent when the immune system is challenged, we subject the mice to a broad spectrum of challenges. A Salmonella typhimurium infection as an example of a bacterial infection is carried out by the team of Gordon Dougan at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. For the 3i assays, we chose influenza as a viral infection, Trichuris muris as a parasite infection and DSS colitis as an example of a chemical stressor. Selected strains will furthermore be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</p>

        <h3 style="font-size:2em;letter-spacing: -1px">How we Call a Hit</h3><br/>
        <p></p>
        <p>Due to different work flows, we use different statistical test to determine if the phenotyping results of a knockout line differ from the wild type mice. The two main approaches we are using are a reference range approach for continuous data and a Fisher’s exact test for categorical data.</p>
        <p>Our statistical analysis is designed to differentiate as efficiently as possible between lines that show a phenotype and lines that do not. However, the criteria for calling a hit are very stringent, in order to make sure that when you order a mouse in, the phenotype we have observed will hold up. The other side of the coin is that we are likely to underestimate the number of true hits, i.e. have a higher number of false negatives. Therefore we encourage you to take a look at the raw data for phenotypes you are interested in and judge for yourself if a borderline case might actually be a true pheotype, even if it hasn't met our very stringent statistical criteria.</p>

            <p>All tests from the observational screen are carried out on mice of the main Sanger phenotyping pipeline. An average of 84 mice are phenotyped every week on two separate days. Due to operational reasons, wild type controls are only processed on one of these days. Knockout mice enter the pipeline according to their age and mice from one strain are phenotyped on at least two different days to avoid any day effects. Due to this set-up, knockout mice cannot be compared to controls on the same day. Using daily controls would also not take advantage of the many wild type data points that are collected over time. It was therefore decided to use a so-called reference range approach to analyse the data.</p>
            <p>Data from at least 70 wild type mice is used to generate a reference range. Knockout lines are considered to be significantly different from wild type mice if 60% of the mice for this strain lie outside the middle 95% of wild type data points, i.e. if they lie above the 97.5th or below the 2.5th percentile of the wild type data. For assays with at least 4 mice per gender, males and females are assessed separately. For assays with 2 or 3 mice per gender, separate reference ranges are constructed for male and female mice, but hits are only called if 60% of samples across both genders are outside their respective reference ranges (3 out of 4 or 4 out of 6).</p>
            <p>The reference range approach does not take into account the actual distribution of the knockout data, therefore a p-value cannot be calculated. The reference range approach is a very stringent method to call hits. Assuming that all samples are independent of each other, false positive rates vary between 1 in 4.8 million for 7 mice per gender per knockout line (e.g. 16 week blood) and 1 in 16,000 for 4 mice per knockout line (e.g. for cytotoxicity).</p>

            <p>The screen for antinuclear antibodies in serum and the test for worm burden in Trichuris infection have a very different data structure than the other assays, as wild types are usually negative and positivity is a strong indication for an abnormal phenotype. These assays are therefore analysed with the categorical Fisher’s exact test. </p>
            <p>Even though the intensity of antinuclear antibody is quantified on a continuous scale, the main readout is the presence or absence of antibody staining. The data is split into negative (scores 0-1) and positive samples (scores 2-5) and analysed categorically. Similarly, worms in the cecum could be counted to assess worm burden, but the more important finding is that worms are present at all.</p>

            <p><b>Comment:</b>Wild type mice clear a Trichuris muris infection completely. Presence of worms in the cecum at day 33 therefore indicates a higher susceptibility. In cases of doubt, high levels of IgG2a in serum will be used to confirm increased susceptibility. Approximately 10% of wild type mice have a low number of worms in the cecum at day 33. Against this background, 4 out of 6 samples for a given knockout line need to be positive to reach a p-value below 0.01.</p>
